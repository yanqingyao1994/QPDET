## Introduction

Abstractâ€”Detecting objects in remote sensing images using oriented bounding boxes is flourishing but challenging, wherein the design of oriented bounding box representations is key to achieving accurate detection. In this paper, we focus on two issues that hinder the performance of two-stage oriented detectors: (i) the notorious boundary discontinuity problem, which would result in significant loss increases in boundary conditions, and (ii) the inconsistency in regression schemes between the two stages. We propose a simple and effective bounding box representation that draws inspiration from the polar coordinate system and integrates it into both two detection stages to circumvent the two issues. The first stage specifically initializes four quadrant points as the starting points of the regression for producing high-quality oriented candidates without any post-processing. In the second stage, the final localization results are refined using the proposed novel bounding box representation, which can fully release the capabilities of the oriented detectors. Such consistency brings a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. With only flipping augmentation and single-scale training and testing, our approach with ResNet-50-FPN harvests 76.25% mAP on the DOTA dataset with a speed of up to 16.5 FPS, achieving the best accuracy and the fastest speed among mainstream two-stage oriented detectors. Additional results on the DIORR and HRSC2016 datasets also demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.
